A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you.The bricks width and height are equal, 
forming a square. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's 
volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will accept these parameters:

radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.

Note:
All inputs are integers.



function iceBrickVolume(radius, bottleLength, rimLength) {
  return 2*(radius**2)*(bottleLength-rimLength); 
}

2*radius**2 are equal to brick width*height;
