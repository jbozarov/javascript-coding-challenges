Your job is to find the gravitational force between two spherical objects (obj1 , obj2).

input
Two arrays are give :

arr_val (value array), consists of 3 elements
1st element : mass of obj 1
2nd element : mass of obj 2
3rd element : distance between their centers
arr_unit (unit array), consists of 3 elements
1st element : unit for mass of obj 1
2nd element : unit for mass of obj 2
3rd element : unit for distance between their centers
