Coding in function ```topSecret```, function accept 1 parameter:```file```. ```file``` is an encrypted string.

Encryption using the right shift 3. Your job is to decrypt the file and read the contents of the file, and then answer my three questions. If the answer is correct, you will pass the test.
Note: the decryption should be left shift; Shift is only for uppercase and lowercase letters, other characters will remain the same; The shift mode is a cyclic shift, for example:
```
character "A" after decryption should be "X" instead of ">"
character "B" after decryption should be "Y" instead of "?"
character "C" after decryption should be "Z" instead of "@"
character "a" after decryption should be "x" instead of "^"
character "b" after decryption should be "y" instead of "_"
character "c" after decryption should be "z" instead of "`"
```
Additional hints: Fixed testcase only test the correctness of the decryption code. The answer to the three question will appear only after clicking on "Submit".

This task may be more difficult for beginners. Good Luck!

Some trainer may have doubts about the three questions, the following is some explanation, I hope to be helpful to the trainer.

for example, after you click "submit", you see these text on your screen:



function topSecret(str){
var ans = "";
for (let i=0; i<str.length; i++){
  let char = str[i];
  if(char.match(/[A-Za-z]/)){
    let code = char.charCodeAt()-3;
    if(code<65){
      code=code+26;
    }else if(code<97 && code>93 ){
      code = code+26;
    }
    char = String.fromCharCode(code);
  }
  ans+=char;
}
return ans;
}
//question1: The top secret file number is...
answer1="3979";
//question2: Super agent's name is...
answer2="cSkM";
//question3: He stole the treasure is...
answer3="Marie's husband";
