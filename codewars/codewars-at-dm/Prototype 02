Here we have a constructor function named User. It takes in 5 parameters, the last being an array of strings that 
represent the user's friends. 

Create a prototype method named addFriend that will take in a string parameter (a new friend) and add that string 
to the user's friends array.

Create a second prototype method named removeFriend that will take in a string parameter (the friend to be unfriended), 
find that friend in the user's friends array and remove it from the array. (Don't worry about capitalization!)
 



function User(name, age, hometown, email, friends) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.hometown = hometown;
  this.email = email;
  this.friends = friends;
}

User.prototype.addFriend=function(string){
	return this.friends.push(string); 
}; 

User.prototype.removeFriend = function (string){
	this.friends = this.friends.filter(val=>val!==string); 
	return this.friends; 
};
