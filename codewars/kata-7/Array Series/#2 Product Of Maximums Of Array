Notes
Array/list size is at least 3 .
Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros

Input >> Output Examples
maxProduct ({4, 3, 5}, 2) ==>  return (20



function maxProduct(numbers, size){
  var arr = numbers.sort((a, b)=>a-b); 
  return arr.slice(arr.length-size, arr.length).reduce((a, b)=>a*b); 
}
