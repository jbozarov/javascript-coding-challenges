Task
Given an array/list [] of integers , Find all the LEADERS in the array.
Notes
Array/list size is at least 3.
Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.
Returned Array/list should store the leading numbers in the same order in the original array/list.
Input >> Output Examples
arrayLeaders ({1, 2, 3, 4, 0}) ==> return {4}
Explanation:
4 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side
Note : The last element 0 is equal to right sum of its elements (abstract zero).
arrayLeaders ({16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}) ==> return {17, 5, 2}




var arrayLeaders = numbers => {	
	numbers.push(0);  
  var result = [];
  for (var i=0; i<numbers.length-1; i++){		
		var sliced = numbers.slice(i+1, numbers.length); 
		if (numbers[i]>sliced.reduce((a, b)=>a+b)){
			result.push(numbers[i]);
			console.log(numbers[i]);  
		}		
	}
	return result; 
}
