Task
Given an array/list [] of integers , Find The maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.
Notes
Array/list size is at least 3.
Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives and negatives also zeros_
Repeatition of numbers in the array/list could occur.
The Maximum Gap is computed Regardless the sign.
Input >> Output Examples
maxGap ({13,10,5,2,9}) ==> return (4)



function maxGap (numbers){
	var sorted = numbers.sort((a, b)=>a-b); 
  var arr = []; 
	for (var i=0; i<sorted.length-1; i++){
		arr.push(Math.abs(sorted[i]-sorted[i+1])); 
	}
	return arr.sort((x, y)=>y-x)[0]; 
}
