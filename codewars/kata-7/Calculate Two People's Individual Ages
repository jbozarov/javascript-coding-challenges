Create a function that takes in the sum and age difference of two people, calculates their individual ages, and 
returns a pair of values if those exist or an empty values if:

sum < 0
difference < 0
Either of the calculated ages come out to be negative


function getAges(sum,difference){
  if (difference<0 || sum<0 || sum<difference) return null; 
  return [sum-(sum-difference)/2, (sum-difference)/2]
};
