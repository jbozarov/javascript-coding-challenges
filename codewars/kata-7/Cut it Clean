In front of you there's a rope of length len. Your task is to cut the rope into n pieces of "equal" length.
Return an array of each piece's length. Order is NOT important.

Requirements:
Each piece should be an integer (rounded to 0dp).
The difference between each piece should be diff <= 1.

Example:
cut(100, 2) => [50, 50]
cut(100, 3) => [33, 33, 34] 



var cut = function(len, num) {
	var arr =[]; 
	for (var i=1; i<=num; i++){
		arr.push(Math.floor(len/num))
	}
  var sum = arr.reduce((x, y)=>x+y); 
	for (var i=0; i<len-sum; i++){
		arr[i]=arr[i]+1; 
	}
  return arr; 
}
