The code provided is supposed return a person's Full Name given their first and last names.
But it's not working properly.
Notes
The first and/or last names are never null (None in Python), but may be empty.


class Dinglemouse {

  constructor( firstName, lastName ){
  this.first = firstName; 
  this.last = lastName; 
  }
  
  getFullName(){
		if (this.first=='') return this.last; 
		else if (this.last=='') return this.first; 
		else return this.first+" "+this.last; 
  }
  
}
