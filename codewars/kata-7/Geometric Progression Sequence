In your class, you have started lessons about geometric progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will print first n elements of the sequence with the given constant r and first element a.

Result should be separated by comma and space.

Example
geometricSequenceElements(2, 3, 5) == '2, 6, 18, 54, 162'


function geometricSequenceElements(a, r, n){
  var arr = [a]; 
	for (var i=1; i<n; i++){
		arr.push(arr[arr.length-1] *r);
}
  return arr.join(', '); 
}
