Your task is to find the number couple with the greatest difference from a given array of number-couples.
All number couples will be given as strings and all numbers in them will be positive integers.
For instance: ['56-23','1-100']; in this case, you should identify '1-100' as the number couple with the greatest difference and return it.

In case there are more than one option, for instance ['1-3','5-7','2-3'], you should identify whichever is first, so in this case '1-3'.

If there is no difference, like so ['11-11', '344-344'], return false.



function diff (str){
	var bb = str.map(a=>a.split('-'));
	var d = bb.map(function(a){
		return a[0]-a[1]; 
	}) 
	var rest = d.map(function(a){
		if (a<0) return a*(-1); 
		else return a; 
	})  
	if (rest.filter(a=>a!==0).length<1) return false; 
	else return  str[rest.indexOf(Math.max(...rest))]
}
