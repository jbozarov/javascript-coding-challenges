Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

Conditions :
N is divisible by divisor

N is less than or equal to bound

N is greater than 0.




function maxMultiple(divisor, bound){
	var num = 0; 
  for (var i=1; i<=bound; i++){
		if (i%divisor==0){
			num=i; 
		}
	} 
	return num; 
}
