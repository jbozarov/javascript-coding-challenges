Scenario
Now that the competition gets tough it will Sort out the men from the boys.
Men are the Even numbers and Boys are the odd  !alt !alt
Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , Separate The even numbers from the odds , or Separate the men from the boys  !alt !alt
Notes
Return an array/list where Even numbers come first then odds
Since , Men are stronger than Boys , Then Even numbers in ascending order While odds in descending.
Array/list size is at least *4***.
Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , negatives.
Have no fear , It is guaranteed that no Zeroes will exists . !alt
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when separating).
Input >> Output Examples:
menFromBoys ({7, 3 , 14 , 17}) ==> return ({14, 17, 7, 3})



function menFromBoys (arr){
	var uniqs = arr.filter((val, ind, ar)=>ar.indexOf(val)==ind); 
	var odd = []; 
	var even = []; 
	var maps = uniqs.map(function(a){
		if (a<0 && a*(-1)%2==0 || a%2==0) return even.push(a); 
		 else if (a<0 && a*(-1)%2!==0 || a%2!==0) return odd.push(a); 
	}) 	 
	return even.sort((a, b)=>a-b).concat(odd.sort((a, b)=>b-a));  
}
