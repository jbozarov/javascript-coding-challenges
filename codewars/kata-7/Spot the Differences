This kata is part of the collection Mary's Puzzle Books.
Mary brought home a "spot the differences" book. The book is full of a bunch of problems, and each problem consists of two 
strings that are similar. However, in each string there are a few characters that are different. An example puzzle from her book is:

String 1: "abcdefg"
String 2: "abcqetg"
Notice how the "d" from String 1 has become a "q" in String 2, and "f" from String 1 has become a "t" in String 2.
It's your job to help Mary solve the puzzles. Write a program spot_diff/Spot that will compare the two strings and return a 
list with the positions where the two strings differ. In the example above, your program should return [3, 5] because String 
1 is different from String 2 at positions 3 and 5.



function spot(s1,s2){
	var result = []; 
  var arr1 = s1.split(''); 
	var arr2 = s2.split(''); 
	for (var i=0; i<arr1.length; i++){
		if (arr1[i]!==arr2[i]){
			result.push(i)
		}
	}
	return result; 
}
