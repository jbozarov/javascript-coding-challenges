Program a function sumAverage(arr) where arr is an array containing arrays full of numbers, for example:

sumAverage([[1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1]]);
First, determine the average of each array. Then, return the sum of all the averages.

All numbers will be less than 100 and greater than -100.
arr will contain a maximum of 50 arrays.
After calculating all the averages, add them all together, then round down, as shown in the example below:
The example given: sumAverage([[3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4], [21, 54, 33, 21, 77]]), the answer being 44.



const sumAverage = (arr) => {
  let result=arr.map(function(a){
		return a.reduce((x, y)=>x+y)/a.length; 
	})  
  return Math.floor(result.reduce((x, y)=>x+y)); 
}
