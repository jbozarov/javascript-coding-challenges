Beaches are filled with sand, water, fish, and sun. Given a string, calculate how many times the words "Sand", 
"Water", "Fish", and "Sun" appear without overlapping (regardless of the case).



function sumOfABeach(beach) {
   var lower = beach.toLowerCase(); 
	 var searchable = /(sand|water|fish|sun)/g; 
	 if (lower.match(searchable)==null) return 0; 
   return lower.match(searchable).length;
}
