Turn an area of a square in to an area of a circle that fits perfectly inside the square.

Example

You get the blue+red area and need to calculate the red area.

Your function gets a number which represents the size of the square and should return the size of the circle. The tests are rounded by 8 decimals to make sure multiple types of solutions work.




function squareAreaToCircle(size){
  return size*Math.PI/4; 
}
